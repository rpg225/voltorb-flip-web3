# Web3 Voltorb Flip - A Decentralized Game
![Voltorb Flip DApp Screenshot](voltorb-flip-web3.png)

## Project Description

This project is a decentralized application (DApp) that brings the classic "Voltorb Flip" mini-game to the blockchain. The core game logic, including board state and scoring, is managed by a Solidity smart contract deployed on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet.

The frontend is built with **Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**, providing a lightweight, fast, and reliable user experience without the overhead of modern frameworks. This project demonstrates core Web3 functionalities, including smart contract development, deployment, and direct frontend interaction using Ethers.js.

## How to Play: The Rules of Voltorb Flip

Voltorb Flip is a game of logic and luck. The goal is to find all the hidden '2' and '3' coin multipliers without flipping over a hidden Voltorb.

*   **The Game Board:** The game is played on a 5x5 grid. Each tile hides either a Voltorb or a number (1, 2, or 3).
*   **Starting the Game:** Click "New Game" to start a new round. Your score (multiplier) will begin at 1.
*   **Flipping Tiles:**
    *   Click on any hidden tile to reveal its value.
    *   If you reveal a **'1'**, your score does not change, but you are safe to continue.
    *   If you reveal a **'2'** or a **'3'**, your current score is multiplied by that number. This is how you win big!
*   **Losing the Game:**
    *   If you flip a tile hiding a **Voltorb (ðŸ’£)**, the game is immediately over, and your score resets to 0.
*   **Winning the Game:**
    *   You win the game by successfully flipping over **all** of the '2' and '3' tiles on the board without hitting any Voltorbs.

Good luck!

## Features

*   **Wallet Connection:** Connects to user's MetaMask wallet.
*   **On-Chain Game Logic:** `startGame` function initializes a new, pseudo-randomized 5x5 game board on the smart contract.
*   **Interactive Gameplay:** `flipTile` function allows users to reveal tiles, with outcomes (coins or Voltorb) and scoring managed immutably on the blockchain.
*   **Event-Driven Updates:** The frontend will listen for smart contract events (`GameStarted`, `TileFlipped`, `GameOver`) to update the UI.
*   **Lightweight Frontend:** A fast and stable user interface built with only HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

## Tech Stack

**Smart Contract (Backend):**
*   **Solidity:** Language for smart contract development.
*   **Hardhat:** Ethereum development environment for compilation and deployment.
*   **OpenZeppelin Contracts:** Utilized for standard `Ownable` contract.
*   **Ethereum Sepolia Testnet:** The public testnet for deployment and gameplay.

**Frontend:**
*   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** For all application logic and DOM manipulation.
*   **Ethers.js (v5, via CDN):** A robust library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain directly from the browser.
*   **HTML5 & CSS3:** For application structure and styling.

## The Development Journey & Tech Stack Evolution

This project was a deep dive into the realities of modern web development and the importance of choosing the right tools for the job.

### Initial Approach: React-based Frameworks

The initial plan was to build the frontend using a modern React framework like Vite or Next.js with Tailwind CSS. However, this path was met with persistent and severe local environment issues, including:

*   **Vite `crypto.hash` Error:** A recurring error related to an incompatibility between Vite's dependencies and certain Node.js versions.
*   **NPM Hanging/Corruption:** `npm install` processes would frequently hang or fail, even after clearing caches and reinstalling dependencies.
*   **Build Tool Configuration Hell:** Significant time was spent debugging complex configuration files (`tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`) and dependency conflicts (`ERR_REQUIRE_ESM`, `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`, Babel parsing errors in Next.js).

### Pivot to Vanilla JS: A Focus on Stability and Fundamentals

After multiple attempts to resolve these build-tool-related issues, a decision was made to pivot to a **"back to basics"** approach. The goal was to eliminate the complex build toolchain as a source of error and focus directly on the core Web3 interaction logic.

**Reasons for switching to Vanilla JS:**
1.  **Stability:** By removing the complex dependency graph of modern frameworks, we created an incredibly stable and predictable development environment. There is no build step, which means "it just works."
2.  **Focus on Fundamentals:** This approach forces a deeper understanding of the DOM, event handling, and direct integration with the Ethers.js library, strengthening core JavaScript skills.
3.  **Performance:** The resulting application is extremely lightweight and fast, with zero framework overhead.

This journey highlights a critical lesson in software engineering: while modern tools offer powerful features, they also introduce layers of abstraction and potential points of failure. Sometimes, the most robust and efficient solution is the simplest one.
